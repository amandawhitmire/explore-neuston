Te Vega Cruise 11 Narrative (No Installment Number).  This was originally hand-written and no author mentioned.  


The activities on this expedition can be divided in three parts:  1) Indoctrination cruises; 2) North-south transect to Mazatlan, Mexico; 3) Attempted transect perpendicular to shore.  

During two short indoctrination cruises off Monterey Bay, the students were instructed in the use of bathythermographs, Nasen bottles, and Tucker trawls and in sea board methods of determining sampling depth, temperature, salinity and oxygen.  A standard station was established in which bottle casts to approximately 2000 m were followed by a series of horizontal hauls with a Tucker trawl. These hauls were at depth intervals of approximately 200 m, and the trawl was equipped with a clock-operated opening and closing device and with a depth-time recorder so that the levels of biological sampling could be determined.  Two hydrographic stations were occupied and ten trawls hauls made on the indoctrination cruises.   

With the students trained for routine stations, a transect was run to Mazatlan, Mexico and back.  On the leg going south, the course was far offshore of Baja California, while on the return trip the water was sampled just outside the continental shelf and there were 16 hydrographic stations occupied and 77 hauls were made with the Tucker trawl.  In addition, 3 Neuston net hauls were made and shore water collecting was pursued at Guadalupe Island, Cape San Lucas and Magdalena Bay.  

Everyone was well indoctrinated when the ship returned to Monterey and another attempt was made to take a transect perpendicular to shore.  The weather was just as bad as during Expedition 10 and the ship returned to port five days after sailing, having penetrated no farther west than   125 degrees W. Long. and taking only 2 hydrographic stations and 10 Tucker trawls.
